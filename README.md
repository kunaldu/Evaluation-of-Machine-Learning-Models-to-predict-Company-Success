# Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-Models-to-predict-Company-Success

In this paper I have used companies dataset from the last 3 decades and modeled machine learning algorithms to classify whether a startup will be successful or a failure. I have deployed Random Forest, XGBoost Classifier and compared performance of other previous approaches to the approach used for success prediction.
